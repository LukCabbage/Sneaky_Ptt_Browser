# Sneaky_Ptt_Browser
This program can get the url of certain article on Webptt, which is one of the most popular websites in Taiwan. 

Unlike directly viewing it via web browsers, such as Safari and Chrome, it allows users access desired pages by typing some keywords via terminal. 

(though the content of article would still be watched in web browsers)


##Required Package
* BeautifulSoup4 install :
https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/
* requests install :
https://pypi.org/project/requests/
* lxml install :
https://pypi.org/project/lxml/

## Simple tutorial
1. `python3 main.py`
2. type the board name that you want to watch
3. check whether there is an article that evokes your interest.
   1. ✔ type the number between ***two dash*** marks `e.g.:-1-`
   2. ✘ type `next/previous/oldest/latest` to get other pages
      1. then you'll turn into the i. section.
4. a shortened url of the article that you want to watch will be printed, YUBBY!


### Some murmurs
In last part, you can either simultaneously press command and double-click the url or just simply copy it and paste in any browser.

Well, it's actually not a big deal in programing, but it took a lot of effort due to the reason that this is my first project **!**

However, it indeed solved some problems of mine, for instance, it avoids continually using mouse to move cursor to get the final page that I want.# Sneaky_Ptt_Browser
